# Car Rental System

The transition to digital technology has largely impacted the way car rental businesses are conducted. Before the digital transformation, traditional methods included storing customer information and transactions on a hard copy, and more recently spreadsheets (Chit et al, 2020). Data had to be recorded manually, which was time-consuming and potentially insecure. The lack of a proper system is also inconvenient to customers (Nor and Mudh, 2020). 

Digital technology has enabled companies to easily overcome these shortcomings, as they can now build applications that not only process information automatically, but also allow customers to make reservations themselves. 

This repository consists of source code for an application that implements a trivial car rental system, where users can:

1. Check the available stock and pricing;	
2. Rent a car for a specific number of days;
3. Return a car they have rented.
   
It automatically manages the stock, and issues a bill upon receiving a return. The system can be used as a prototype for car retailer companies that have yet to transform their businesses into those which take advantage of digital technology. 
As it only act as an outline, a terminal interface is used for all input and output, making it simple enough to be adapted to any platform of choice.
